# ðŸ’° Finance API

A simple financial API built with **Ruby on Rails** that supports:

- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Role-based access control (admin / regular)
- Balance management and transfers
- Admin namespace for user and transfer management

## Features

- JWT authentication (`POST /login`)
- User registration (`POST /users`)
- Account balance viewing
- Transfers between users
- Admin routes for:
  - Viewing all users
  - Updating user roles

## Technologies

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- JWT for authorization

## Setup

### Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelaGasparyan3/financial_api.git
cd financial_api
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate rails db:seed
rails server
```

## Run all tests:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
## Code Style â€“ RuboCop:
```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```
## Quick Test Script:
 A shell script is included to quickly test the core functionality of the API using curl commands.

### Run the Tests:
```bash
  chmod +x quick_curl_tests.sh
  ./quick_curl_tests.sh
```
### What it Tests
  - User creation (Alice, Bob)
  - User login and JWT token retrieval
  - Admin login and role update
  - Access control (user can view own profile, but not others')
  - Fund transfers between users
  - Admin viewing all users and transfers

Output
-The script prints each step and shows formatted JSON responses using jq. Youâ€™ll see:
-Created users with IDs
-Tokens assigned to each user
-Successful and failed access attempts
-Balance checks and transfer results

Requirements

- jq installed (for JSON formatting)
- Your Rails server running on http://localhost:3000
You can install jq if missing:
```bash
  # macOS
  brew install jq
  
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install jq

```
